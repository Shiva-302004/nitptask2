# IMAGE MANAGEMENT APP

## Link:- https://imageapp300.netlify.app/

In this app user can add image with caption and user can only post if user is logged in. It has certain extra features like comments on post and like and dislike on post.

If user is logged in under my posts section he will get the option of adding image and deleting image.Under myposts ssection user will get all his posts. 

All the data like like count and comments count and comments on post is fetched from backend.

### Backend Deployment Link

I have used nodejs and expressjs for making backend and for storing data i have used mongodb database.for storing image i have used s3 bucket (aws).

since backend is hosted on free platfrom so response is delayed by 1 minute initially.
